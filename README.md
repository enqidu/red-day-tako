# Happy Red Day (Tako)
A tiny single-page website with three bouncing pixel sprites and celebratory pixel-fireworks.

## Local preview
Open `index.html` in a browser.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages
1. Create a new public repo, e.g. **red-day-tako**.
2. Upload these files (keep the `assets/` folder).
3. In the repo: **Settings → Pages → Branch: `main` (or `master`)** and select `/ (root)` for the folder. Save.
4. Wait a minute for the site to build. Your page will be live at:
   `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`

If you later add/replace images in `assets/`, commit the changes and Pages will auto-update.

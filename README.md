# Happy Red Day (Tako) – v6
Fixes:
- Banner back to the top with original glowing style
- Proper layering: canvas (0), sprites (1), banner (3), overlay (4)
- DVD-style bounce restored and constrained so characters never hide under the banner
- Speech bubbles render at the character position (relative to #stage)
- Keeps: background music, auto fireworks, overlay reveal with game-over SFX, interactions

Deploy the same way via GitHub Pages.
